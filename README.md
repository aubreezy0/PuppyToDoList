# PuppyToDoList
## A list of feats a puppy must accomplish to win a human, make itself at home, and have fun with (and without) said human. 
### Phase one and two: Entering a new To Do and seeing it on the To Do List

A To Do item entered on the addToDoViewController is passed to the ToDoTableViewController and uses .tableView.reloadData() to refresh the table and show the new To Do.
